## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub-repository of my personal passion project! Here you can find the code and assets I used to bring this project to life. You can follow my journey through this project on [my blog](https://kajdemuynckppp.wordpress.com/) and maybe I'll be able to teach you something or inspire you to create your own 3D multiplayer game.
